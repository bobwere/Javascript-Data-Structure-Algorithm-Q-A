Javascript Data Structure &amp; Algorithm Q/A

As a JavaScript developer you might think you don’t need to learn about data structures or algorithms.
Did you know JavaScript itself (runtime + browser) uses things like a stack, a heap and a queue? The more you understand the JavaScript you use on a daily basis – really understand it, the better you can wield it’s power and make less mistakes. If you thought algorithms and data structures were just a computer science course that wasn’t necessary on a day to day basis as JavaScript developer, think again!
Each exercise covers an algorithm you might encounter in your work or at an interview.
You can work through the algorithms one at a time or feel free to jump around.
